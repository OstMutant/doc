		The Module is the basic unit of definition of bindings
		Guice has adopted a code-first approach for dependency injection and management so you won’t be dealing with a lot of XML out-of-the-box.
		you define how Guice is going to inject dependencies into a class.
		A binding is defined in an implementation of com.google.inject.AbstractModule
		Another incarnation of this mechanism is the named binding. 
		You can also inject a dependency that doesn’t have a default no-arg constructor using constructor binding:
		Another approach to constructor-specific binding is the instance binding
		Types of Dependency Injection
			Field Injection
			Method Injection
			Constructor Injection
			Implicit Injections
		 Scoping in Guice
			Singleton.  This singleton is lazily initiated by default.
			Eager Singleton
		
		How can an application or class be independent of how its objects are created?
		How can the way objects are created be specified in separate configuration files?
		How can an application support different configurations?
		
---------- Dependency Injection Benefits(http://tutorials.jenkov.com/dependency-injection/dependency-injection-benefits.html)
		These benefits are explained in
			Reduced Dependencies
			Reduced Dependency Carrying
			More Reusable Code
			More Testable Code
			More Readable Code
		Cons(https://gist.github.com/r00k/3105024)
			It's harder to understand how a class works when reading just that class. You may have to track down its invocation to see what kind of components are passed in.

		The Dependency Injection design pattern solves problems like: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
			How can an application or class be independent of how its objects are created?
			How can the way objects are created be specified in separate configuration files?
			How can an application support different configurations?
			
		Advantages
			Dependency injection allows a client the flexibility of being configurable. Only the client's behavior is fixed. 
				The client may act on anything that supports the intrinsic interface the client expects.
			Dependency injection can be used to externalize a system's configuration details into configuration files, allowing the system to be reconfigured without recompilation. 
				Separate configurations can be written for different situations that require different implementations of components. This includes, but is not limited to, testing.
			Because dependency injection doesn't require any change in code behavior it can be applied to legacy code as a refactoring. 
				The result is clients that are more independent and that are easier to unit test in isolation using stubs or mock objects that simulate other objects not under test. 
				This ease of testing is often the first benefit noticed when using dependency injection.
			Dependency injection allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use. 
				This helps isolate the client from the impact of design changes and defects. It promotes reusability, testability and maintainability.[22]
			Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects, since all work to initialize or set up dependencies is handled by a provider component.[22]
			Dependency injection allows concurrent or independent development. 
				Two developers can independently develop classes that use each other, while only needing to know the interface the classes will communicate through. 
				Plugins are often developed by third party shops that never even talk to the developers who created the product that uses the plugins.
			Dependency Injection decreases coupling between a class and its dependency.[23][24]
		Disadvantages
			Dependency injection creates clients that demand configuration details be supplied by construction code. This can be onerous when obvious defaults are available.
			Dependency injection can make code difficult to trace (read) because it separates behavior from construction. This means developers must refer to more files to follow how a system performs.
			Dependency injection frameworks are implemented with reflection or dynamic programming. This can hinder use of IDE automation, such as "find references", "show call hierarchy" and safe refactorings.
			Dependency injection typically requires more upfront development effort since one can not summon into being something right when and where it is needed but must ask that it be injected and then ensure that it has been injected.
			Dependency injection forces complexity to move out of classes and into the linkages between classes which might not always be desirable or easily managed.[25]
			Dependency injection can encourage dependence on a dependency injection framework

GraphQL(https://www.baeldung.com/guice)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
			GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, 
			makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
		
		What is GraphQL?
			GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 which provides a common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and manipulations.
			The client asks for various data from the GraphQL server via queries. The response format is described in the query and defined by the client instead of the server: they are called client‐specified queries.
			The structure of the data is not hardcoded as in traditional REST APIs - this makes retrieving data from the server more efficient for the client.
		
		Key concepts of the GraphQL query language are:
			Hierarchical
			Product‐centric
			Strong‐typing
			Client‐specified queries
			Introspective
			
		Explain the main difference between REST and GraphQL
			The main and most important difference between REST and GraphQL is that GraphQL is not dealing with dedicated resources, 
				instead everything is regarded as a graph and therefore is connected and can be queried to app exact needs.
				
		How to do Server-side Caching?
			One common concern with GraphQL, especially when comparing it to REST, are the difficulties to maintain server-side cache. 
				With REST, it’s easy to cache the data for each endpoint, since it’s sure that the structure of the data will not change.
			With GraphQL on the other hand, it’s not clear what a client will request next, so putting a caching layer right behind the API doesn’t make a lot of sense.
			Server-side caching still is a challenge with GraphQL.
		Disadvantages:
			You need to learn how to set up GraphQL. The ecosystem is still rapidly evolving so you have to keep up.
			You need to send the queries from the client, you can just send strings but if you want more comfort and caching you'll use a client library -> extra code in your client
			You need to define the schema beforehand => extra work before you get results
			You need to have a graphql endpoint on your server => new libraries that you don't know yet
			Graphql queries are more bytes than simply going to a REST endpoint
			The server needs to do more processing to parse the query and verify the parameters
		
		Common Questions (https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/5-common-questions/)
			How to do Error Handling?
			A successful GraphQL query is supposed to return a JSON object with a root field called "data". 
			If the request fails or partially fails (e.g. because the user requesting the data doesn’t have the right access permissions), a second root field called "errors" is added to the response:
			 {
			  "data": { ... },
			  "errors": [ ... ]
			}
			
		GraphQL(https://medium.freecodecamp.org/so-whats-this-graphql-thing-i-keep-hearing-about-baf4d36c20cf)
			GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics:
				It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
				It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
				It uses a type system to describe data.
				
			In practice, a GraphQL API is organized around three main building blocks: the schema, queries, and resolvers.
			
			The request you make to your GraphQL personal assistant is the query, and it looks something like this:
				query getMyPost($id: String) {
				  post(id: $id){
					title
					body
					author{
					  name
					  avatarUrl
					  profileUrl
					}
				  }
				}
			We’re declaring a new query using the query keyword, then asking for a field named stuff. The great thing about GraphQL queries is that they support nested fields, so we can go one level deeper:
			
			A resolver tells GraphQL how and where to fetch the data corresponding to a given field. For example, here’s what a resolver for the post field above could look like (using Apollo’s GraphQL-Tools schema generator):
			Query: {
			  post(root, args) {
				return Posts.find({ id: args.id });
			  }
			}
